# Data_Exploration_and_Visualization_Project
The Data Exploration and Visualization Project is divided into two distinct parts, each with its own unique focus and set of skills. The first part delves into Covid-19 data exploration using Microsoft SQL Server, while the second part centres around Covid-19 Data Visualization using Tableau. Despite utilizing the same dataset obtained from the "Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths - Our World in Data" website, both parts are independent projects with differing queries and skill levels.

In the first part, the data is explored using SQL queries, and in the second part, visualisations are created in Tableau after extracting the data into Excel files using SQL queries.
PART I - Data Exploration using Microsoft SQL Server:
    This segment encompasses a wide range of skills, from fundamental to advanced levels, including Standard Queries, Data Filtering, Aggregate Functions, Windows Functions,       Converting Data Types, Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, and Creating Views. It is further divided into two sections, comprising a total of 13 queries, with 9 queries dedicated to     COVID-19 deaths and 4 queries focused on COVID-19 vaccinations.
PART II - Data Visualization using Tableau:
    In this part, emphasis is placed on skills ranging from basic to medium levels, involving the extraction of data into Excel files for visualization in Tableau. This            section features 4 distinct visualizations, including 3 KPIs, a bar chart depicting total deaths per continent, a line chart illustrating the percentage of the population      infected, and a map displaying the percentage of the population infected per country.
